# Quick Authentication Steps

Please run these commands in your **separate terminal** (Command Prompt or PowerShell):

## Step 1: Authenticate with Railway
```bash
cd "D:\PIAIC Batch 76\HackatonII\backend"
railway login
```
- This will open a browser window
- Click "Authorize" to allow Railway CLI access
- Close browser when done
- Return here and let me know it's complete

## Step 2: Authenticate with Vercel
```bash
cd "D:\PIAIC Batch 76\HackatonII\frontend"
npx vercel login
```
- This will open a browser window
- Click "Confirm" to verify login
- Close browser when done
- Return here and let me know it's complete

## Once you've completed both steps above, I'll handle the rest:
- ✅ Create Railway project
- ✅ Configure environment variables
- ✅ Deploy backend
- ✅ Create Vercel project
- ✅ Configure frontend
- ✅ Deploy frontend
- ✅ Update CORS settings
- ✅ Test everything

**After completing the authentication steps, type "done" or "authenticated" and I'll proceed with the deployment!**
